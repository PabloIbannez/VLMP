Sharing Your Extension
=======================

If you have developed an extension and wish to share it, the recommended process is to fork the main repository and work on your extension in your own fork. Once your extension is completed and tested, you can submit a pull request (PR) to have it reviewed and potentially merged into the main project.

To ensure your pull request is accepted, please make sure to follow these essential guidelines:

1. **Testing**:
   - Your pull request must include one or more tests that clearly demonstrate that your extension works as intended. 
   - Each test should be properly explained, detailing what it does and how it verifies the correct functionality of your extension.
   
2. **Documentation**:
   - You must update the relevant documentation to include information about how your extension works and how to use it.
   - Ensure that the documentation is placed in the appropriate section(s).

3. **Version Update**:
   - Before submitting the pull request, make sure to update the version number of the program in the `pyproject.toml` file.
